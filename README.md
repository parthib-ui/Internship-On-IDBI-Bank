🏦 About IDBI Bank

IDBI Bank Ltd. (Industrial Development Bank of India) is one of India’s leading public sector banks. Established in 1964, it was originally created to provide credit and financial assistance for industrial growth in India. Over the years, IDBI Bank evolved into a full-service commercial bank offering a wide range of retail and corporate banking products.

The bank’s mission is to deliver comprehensive financial solutions that combine innovation, accessibility, and trust. With an extensive branch network and robust digital infrastructure, IDBI serves millions of customers across India. It is known for maintaining a balance between customer-centric retail banking and strategic corporate financing.

Retail banking plays a major role in IDBI’s growth — providing financial services directly to individuals rather than businesses. This includes savings accounts, current accounts, fixed deposits, personal loans, and more. My internship at the Madhyamgram Branch gave me an opportunity to witness and understand these functions from close proximity.

📘 Overview of the Internship

The internship was carried out at IDBI Bank Madhyamgram Branch as part of the academic requirement for my Bachelor’s degree. The main objective of this internship was to gain practical exposure to retail banking, understand how different operations are managed at the branch level, and contribute to day-to-day activities under supervision.

The internship duration was six weeks — from June 6, 2024 to July 19, 2024. During this time, I worked with different teams within the branch to understand core banking operations, customer onboarding, account management, KYC procedures, and performance reporting.

The project associated with my internship was titled “Retail Banking and Its Challenges.” It involved observing the functioning of the retail department, identifying operational challenges, and performing a data-based analysis on the RBG Liability Report dataset to measure how the branch improved during the internship period.

🎯 Objectives of the Internship

The internship was designed to meet both learning and operational objectives. Some of the primary goals included:

Understanding Retail Banking Functions:
To explore how IDBI Bank delivers services like account opening, deposits, loans, and customer service.

Exposure to Regulatory Compliance:
To understand the importance of KYC (Know Your Customer), CKYC, and Aadhaar verification as part of regulatory banking norms.

Learning from Field Work:
To observe and participate in on-ground customer service activities, learning how banking services are delivered outside the branch premises.

Analyzing Branch Performance through Data:
To use the branch’s RBG Liability Report dataset to assess performance metrics, such as account growth and deposit trends.

Identifying Challenges and Solutions:
To identify the practical challenges faced in retail banking operations and propose potential improvements based on observation and data findings.

🏢 Branch and Departmental Exposure

The Madhyamgram Branch of IDBI Bank is a busy and customer-facing branch located in a growing suburban area. The branch handles a large volume of retail customers daily, including individuals and small business owners.

During my internship, I worked primarily in the Retail Banking Department. I had the opportunity to interact with staff in different roles — from customer service representatives and operations executives to assistant managers. This provided me with a well-rounded understanding of how the branch functions on a daily basis.

Some of the major tasks and exposure areas included:

Account Opening Section: Learning the step-by-step process for opening new savings and current accounts, including document verification and data entry into the banking system.

Customer Service Section: Observing how customers’ requests, complaints, and queries are handled both in-person and through phone interactions.

KYC and Verification Section: Understanding the procedures involved in verifying customer identities through Aadhaar and PAN cards, as well as completing CKYC records.

Field Operations: Accompanying staff members during off-branch activities such as partnership drives, customer onboarding campaigns, and verification visits.

⚙️ Internship Activities and Responsibilities

Throughout the six-week internship, I was assigned various responsibilities under supervision. These included both clerical and analytical tasks. The major activities can be summarized as follows:

1. Account Opening and Documentation

Assisted in opening more than 200 discipline accounts, including savings and current accounts.

Helped customers fill out forms, verify required documents, and understand the features of their accounts.

Entered customer details into the IDBI account management system under staff guidance.

2. Aadhaar and KYC/CKYC Verification

Verified Aadhaar and PAN details using the official verification portal.

Ensured that customers’ identity and address proof documents complied with RBI standards.

Analyzed how the branch performed in terms of account openings, deposits, and KYC compliance over the internship period.

Identified trends that indicated improvements in customer acquisition and service efficiency.

📊 Dataset-Based Analysis

One of the most valuable parts of this internship was working with real banking data. I analyzed the RBG Liability Report, which contained details on new accounts, deposits, and verification statuses.

Using this dataset, I identified key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:

Total number of new accounts opened per week.

Growth in savings and current account balances.

Percentage of customers who completed KYC/CKYC.

Turnaround time for Aadhaar verification.

Overall liability growth at the branch level.

From this analysis, it was evident that the Madhyamgram Branch showed noticeable improvement during the internship period. The number of new accounts increased steadily, KYC completion rates improved, and the overall deposit base grew — reflecting enhanced branch performance.
